Description: G-computation for a set of time-fixed exposures
    with quantile-based basis functions, possibly under linearity and
    homogeneity assumptions. This approach estimates a regression line
    corresponding to the expected change in the outcome (on the link
    basis) given a simultaneous increase in the quantile-based category
    for all exposures. Works with continuous, binary, and right-censored
    time-to-event outcomes.  Reference: Alexander P. Keil, Jessie P.
